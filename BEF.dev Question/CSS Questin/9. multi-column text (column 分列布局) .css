/* 9. multi-column text

It is very common to see text in multiple columns on newspaper, please achieve something similar in this problem.

Suppose you have HTML structure like below.

<div class="three-column-text">
  some very very long text
</div>
Complete the CSS code according to following requirements

divide into 3 columns
use 1px line of #ddd as separator
adding 10px space around each column, to container border and to the separator
The text used in test doesn't contain space but has forced line break to show padding/margin clearly.

*/

.three-column-text {
    /* your code here*/
    columns: 3 auto; /*把空间平均分成3列*/
    column-rule: solid 1px #ddd; /*use 1px line of #ddd as separator*/
    column-gap: 20px; /*adding 10px space around each column 每一列到分隔符的间距是10px*/
    padding: 10px; /*每一列到容器边框的间距是10px*/
}
